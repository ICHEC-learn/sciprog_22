### Folder structure
1. The 'dynamicAllocation.c' file includes the allocatearray(), fillwithones(), and printarray() function
2. The calculator main function code in the 'finde.c' file


### Exercise

Basic C Pointers and dynamic memory allocation:

1. Write a function allocatearray() that takes an integer as an argument and returns a pointer to an allocated memory block of that many integers.
2. Write a function fillwithones() that takes a pointer to an array of integers and fills every cell of the array with a one. What other argument do you need to pass to this function?
3. Write a function printarray() that takes a pointer to an array of integers and prints its elements on screen.
4. Write a function to free the allocated memory.
5. Call all these functions into a main block. Run with different array sizes.
