1. The 'GCD.c' file include the GCD calculation codes


### Exercise

- Write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed as arguments. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder.

1. Use the pseudo code to construct an iterative function.
2. Construct a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code.

**Answer:**

Please enter two positive integers:
8 4
IterativeGCD(8, 4)=4
RecursiveGCD(8, 4)=4


Please enter two positive integers:
10, 13
Please enter two integers
